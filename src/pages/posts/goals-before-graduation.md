I'm basically graduating in march of 2025 so I'm setting some learning goals for myself. I'll try to finish as much as possible from this in order.

> If you are reading this. Don't mind random slop AI-way-of-writing. I was too lazy to convert my bullet points to a well structured guide myself.

### 1. **Expand and improve my Go knowledge**

Since I'm already using **Go** at work most of the time I'm planning on diving deeper into language concepts.

- **Learn Core Concepts**
  - Advanced concurrency (goroutines, channels, mutexes, etc.)
  - Package design and modularity
  - Testing and benchmarking in Go
  - Go tooling: `go mod`, `go vet`, `go test`, `go generate`
- **Understand Behind-the-Scenes**
  - Garbage collection in Go
  - Memory management and pointers
  - Go runtime and scheduler
- **Analyze Pros and Cons**
  - Explore ideal use cases: Microservices, backend APIs, CLI tools, concurrent programs
- **Explore Helpful Sectors for Go**
  - Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP)
  - DevOps tools, microservices, and API gateways
  - Backend services for AI/ML systems (e.g., model-serving tools)

### 2. **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**

I. suck. at. DSA. Simple as that.

I know nothing other than **Arrays**, **Linked Lists**, **Sorting**, and basic **Trees**.

- **Platforms to Use:**
  - NeetCode (priority for structured learning)
  - LeetCode (grind problems - usual basis)
  - HackerRank (for certifications and competitions)
- **Concepts to Focus On:**
  - Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues
  - Graphs and trees
  - Dynamic programming and recursion
  - Time and space complexity analysis
- **Languages to Use:**
  - C++ (Primarily)
  - Go (Re-implement for fun)

### 3. **Mathematics for Computer Science**

It's been years since I last touched maths properly. I was good at maths in highschool days but after covid I just never touched anything academics related.

- **Topics to Study:**
  - Discrete mathematics
  - Linear algebra and matrix operations
  - Probability and statistics
  - Number theory
- **Resources:**
  - [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/) (After cutting expenses or if someone would be willing to sponsor.)
  - [Lamar University Tutorials](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/)
  - [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) for coding problems requiring math
    - Using **Python**
- **Why Important:**
  - I enjoy it. Very helpful for complex things.
    - Builds strong foundation for AI/ML and systems-level work

---

### 4. **AI/ML Exploration**

Another fun-to-learn thing from my bucket list. I work with AI gen models and LLMs at work. I'm also making some CLI tools that use LLMs and improve my workflow.

- **First Steps:**
  - Learn Python (since it's widely used for AI/ML)
  - Familiarize myself with core libraries: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn
- **Core Concepts to Study:**
  - Linear models (regression, classification)
  - Neural networks, deep learning basics (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
  - Reinforcement learning, NLP, and computer vision basics
- **Applications in Work:**
  - Helpful when dealing with AI models or listening to AI guy just throw buzzwords at me.
  - Also helpful when I'm dealing with LLMs so I atleast know what's going on behind the scene
  - Might aswell turn into an AI guy in future... who knows ╰(_°▽°_)╯

### 5. **Systems Programming & Low-Level Work**

- **Languages to Focus On:**
  - C, C++, Assembly, Rust (for memory management and performance)
- **Concepts to Learn:**
  - OS internals (processes, threads, and memory management)
  - Network protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP)
  - File systems, compilers, and interpreters
- **Projects:**
  - Build CLI tools and system utilities in Go
  - Implement small parts of an OS or networking stack in C
- **Why Important:**
  - Strong foundation for embedded systems, and AI optimization (ai optimization? i'll just leave this here 'cause GPT-chan mentioned it)

---

### **Learning Flow**

1. **Deep dive of Go while working** (can use my learnings at work and with personal projects).
2. **Parallelly starting DSA practice**—will help with many things. With work, projects and implementing complex things.
3. **Refreshing math skills** to better prepare for AI/ML and advanced algorithms.
4. **Begin AI/ML once math foundations are in place**.
5. **Explore low-level systems programming** when I'm done with other things. (DSA and Go mainly).
