    This is more of a about me first and then about why I'm learning from scratch, you can skip the backstory and skip
    directly to <a href="#mainsection">"Why"</a> part (at the end of page).

      This post is totally raw, don't mind if you feel too weird
      reading this. You can simply close the tab and never open this page of posts section again. Also, pardon my
      English
      here.
      By writing this post I don't want others to change the way they preceive me or give me attention. I just wanted to
      share my story, that's it.

  <p>A bit about my background first. I've been programming since the age of 12, most of the things i did/learned were
    just me exploring things as a kid. I come from a family with zero people who are into tech or know about tech
    sector. I used to get scolded a lot just because I'd spend hours sitting in front of my first ever computer with
    that 2G internet searching "How can I make games in one day?".</p>

  <p>At the age of 14 I was confident enough to build websites and a random dude on internet introduced me to
    freelancing. Well, I was a kid was super motivated about being called a web developer and now I also had an
    opportunity in front of me to earn some money. I was super shy, nerdy and silent kid so I being that motivated
    started working for that guy. He'd keep 40% and i'll keep 60% of the payment... Which imo was a good deal for me at
    that age. He'd get me work i'll work for him without anyone noticing what i'm doing and get the money from him then
    buy expensive pens and flex them in my class. Yes, I used to love pens. (i still do)</p>

  <p>After some time I did a big project and got a decent amount of money, I didn't know what to do with that much money
    so I just handed it over to my folks and they asked me how i got it then i explained all the things and they were
    shocked that i was so sharp and blah blah. They were proud but they were scared at the same time, idk why but they
    were lol. They let me continue what I was doing and they also got me a decent laptop. It was a <strong>Thinkpad
      T450</strong>.</p>

  <p>Fast forwarding to when I first got a mobile phone and joined telegram because someone told me that there's this
    hacking community that helps ppl learn how to hack. Again, my dumb ass joined it and well here we go. They
    introduced me to "Kali Linux" and how I can explore and learn things in hacking. Hacking was a big word for me. So,
    I got close to a guy who was frank to me and started learning basics from him asking him for resources and exploring
    on my own. He introduced me to TryHackMe, VulnHub and HackTheBox (gosh those days).</p>

  <p>I spent a couple of months learning basic networking, linux internals, bash scripting, python, nmap, wireshark,
    burpsuite and such basic tools. After some time I started solving VulnHub machines, then I got into THM and after
    couple more months I got into HTB. That was an amazing journey and I thought I was good enough now. Then I decided
    to take CCNA, then CEH and then OSCP exams. BUT after telling my folks that I want to do this I just directly told
    them I'm learning hacking and all. Hacking ofc is a big word so they bonked me and warned me to stay max to coding
    and not go for hacking and stuff. As a lol kid that was depressing for me and I left coding as well but then I lost
    interest in playing games as well. Then I slowly got back into web development out of bore and started working again
    taking small gigs and earning for some extra pocket money.</p>

  <p>After some time I came across Bug Bounty hunting, (here we go again) soo... I explored that too xD portswigger's
    site lol I still remember myself messing around and not understanding a thing. sql injections, xss, csrf attacks and
    all that. LMAO. Then I made an account on HackerOne and earned some dollars from some simple SQLi bugs there (guess
    i got lucky there). SQLi in those days was pretty common tho. I was super happy until I found myself in a void of
    "wtf am I even doing?". So, I got to web development (again)</p>

  <p>Welcome to highschool days!! Covid19 days lol. I spent more time just doing web development during starting of
    covid and I sold my Thinkpad and got a new laptop HP 15s (yikes. worst decision of my life. I SOLD A FREAKING
    THINKPAD DUDE!!). This laptop was actually nice like it had 8 gigs of ram a nice ssd and R5 3400 something. Anyways,
    so I decided to explore what more I can do in coding and I got to know about android application development (Hello,
    Java!). Then I spent some months working in web dev and learning android dev alongside. And then I spent some more
    months learning android dev, plus, in middle of that I came to know that there's a part of web development called
    "Backend Development". YAY!! NEW ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED!! (istg wtf was i even exploring). Then I was shocked like
    wtfff isss thisss shiiii and started learning that too. NodeJS and that was when I entered the JS hell. I never
    missed a single chance of using JavaScript after that.</p>

  <p>Finishing off with backend development, I started learning ReactJS and I was shocked by seeing what it was capable
    of and I made a combo of ReactJS + Bootstrap + FontAwesome Icons + NodeJS + MySQL. EZ MONEY!! I made lots of money
    as a kid (not A LOT lot but a lot from a kid's POV) from making small projects for local businesses and working as a
    freelance web dev.</p>

  <p>Welcome to college days!! YAY!! Not fun at all. Everyone used to think of me as a super cool programmer because I
    knew python and web dev from the very start + I had knowledge of Linux. (These were my subjects in starting days of
    college). They actually were pretty easy for me to deal and with everyone seeing me as a programming god I felt good
    at first but slowly as time passed I stopped learning, exploring at all. I'd just sit there and see ppl in uni grind
    DSA, LeetCode and whatnot. I'd be sitting there in my own world thinking what am I even doing here, I don't belong
    here, this is not a place, I can't do this and more crap.</p>

  <p>I'd like to skip my trauma here ffs</p>

  <p>In short, a friend of mine saved me from all the self questioning. Trust me, just talking about it really helped me
    a lot. Thanks to them I was able to get back to what I used to love doing at some point. Then I started grinding
    again, I learned about more things but everything web dev. I came across PicoGYM and PicoCTF from John Hammond's
    Channel (John Hammond (cutie), LiveOverflow, NetworkChuck were some of my fav yt channels at that time.) and I gave
    them a shot and tbh I liked them a lot. I started grinding basics from PicoGYM and started reading about how to
    solve CTF challenges and also started taking guidance from the cybersec community I was in during early days. One
    thing I learned at that time was "You need to know how things are made in order to see how you can break them.". So,
    I started learning basics of whatever i'd get stuck with and build a basic thing in it then try to break it somehow
    (crack it is a better word ig). That's how I learned basics of many many things- c, cpp, java, python, go, bash,
    linux, using nginx and apache2 lol i don't even remember all the things at this point.</p>

  <p>I tried little bit of everything I could. I always had a basic understanding of how something is working but never
    knew how it actually is built from the base up. I never ever had a clear path to learning things I messed around,
    figured out, learned and implemented what I thought was right. Even in college they taught us fundamentals which
    were of no use imo. Some topics sure are helpful but the way some universities are nowadays is weird (or atleast
    mine is). That's why I'm a <q>jack of all trades but master of none, but often better than a master of one.</q></p>

  <p id="bc">
    I missed out on a lots of things in this (some were intentional while some were not ;P) also, ofc, I can't type my
    whole story like that. I don't even remember many cases. I'll list some that i remember now tho.

  <ul>
    <li>I have spent four months in one CTF team and two in another (for web and rev category)</li>
    <li>Worked with multiple startups as a web developer just because I didn't had anything else to do in my life.
    </li>
    <li>I've gone through a looots of worse days where I couldn't even get myself to write code because i'd feel
      anxious even coding.</li>
    <li>I never learned a single thing from my academics. Always learned on my own (google was/is my bestfriend)</li>
    <li>I never got the change to do give CCNA, CEH or OSCP exam. I'll do it someday tho.</li>
  </ul>

  <span id="mainsection">Main Section</h4>

    <p>Now, I'm in a good state and working as a tech lead at yet another startup. BUT. I'm mostly covered with web
      development work... Which is now getting annoying for me as I don't see anything other than websites in my life.
      Sure, web dev is a main part of internet but I need a break from it and I don't want to go for it professionally
      anymore. So, I've decided to learn programming from scratch and go for low-level and systems programming.
      Hopefully,
      I'll get a job in that sector one day. Even if doesn't pay well I'll be going for that 'cause I know I'll be happy
      doing something different. I've made this <a href="https://x.com/0x_syk">new account on x dot com</a> just for
      this one thing primarily. To stay there as an anon, learn, share, motivate others from my learnings and just
      grind.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll use this posts section to post random things of HowTos if possible. Share learning resources and tips here.
      Rant/Vent.
