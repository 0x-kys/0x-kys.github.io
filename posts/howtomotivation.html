  <p>Here's a small lil' list of quotes I love.</p>

  <ul id="quotes">
    <li>
      <q>
        <em>
          I'd rather be out there grinding than later sitting on the couch, wondering what could've been if I'd just
          tried.
        </em>
      </q>
    </li>

    <li>
      <q>
        <em>
          If I wait for motivation to strike, I'll be stuck here forever. Time to fight through the pain and get
          stronger!
        </em>
      </q>
    </li>

    <li>
      <q>
        <em>
          30 minutes of focused effort = 30 minutes of knowledge gained.
        </em>
      </q>
    </li>

    <li>
      <q>
        <em>
          This is just another tough boss fight. Time to level up, learn the boss's moves, and take it down!
        </em>
      </q>
    </li>

    <li>
      <q>
        <em>
          There are a million reasons to quit, but only one reason to keep going: <strong>getting better</strong>.
        </em>
      </q>
    </li>

  </ul>

  <p>Dear Anon, If you every feel like quitting just remember why you started and how far you've come from that part.
    Ofc, there
    are times when you go through shit but it doesn't mean that you have to just stay in there and keep on overthinking
    about it. Skipping for a couple of days (for me) makes me lazy to continue. That's why I learn everyday even if it's
    a little portion of the thing I'm learning. Do what you think is best for you. Also, don't worry about what others
    might think
    of you. Show up everyday and do your best!!</p>
