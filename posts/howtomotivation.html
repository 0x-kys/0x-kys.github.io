  <p>Bello oomfs.</p>

  <p>When I start doing/learning something on my own I get super excited about it and do the best I can at it and as
    time goes on I start to lose interest in it. I've always relied on external validations, money and stuff as
    motivation. (I guess we all do)</p>

  <p>So, here is a small lil' post with some blocks of things that help me lock back in even at the hardest times of my
    life.</p>

  <ul id="quotes">
    <li>
      <q>
        <em>
          I'd rather be out there grinding than later sitting on the couch, wondering what could've been if I'd just
          tried.
        </em>
      </q>
    </li>

    <li>
      <q>
        <em>
          If I wait for motivation to strike, I'll be stuck here forever. Time to fight through the pain and get
          stronger!
        </em>
      </q>
    </li>

    <li>
      <q>
        <em>
          Hard work pays off, period.
        </em>
      </q>
    </li>

    <li>
      <q>
        <em>
          30 minutes of focused effort = 30 minutes of knowledge gained. LFG!!
        </em>
      </q>
    </li>

    <li>
      <q>
        <em>
          This is just another tough boss fight. Time to level up, learn the boss's moves, and take it down!
        </em>
      </q>
    </li>

    <li>
      <q>
        <em>
          There are a million reasons to quit, but only one reason to keep going: <strong>getting better</strong>.
        </em>
      </q>
    </li>

    <li>
      <q>
        <em>
          I've got skill issue, and it won't fix itself. Time to grind and improve every aspect I can.
        </em>
      </q>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Welp welp- These were some of the things that popped in my head as a quote-like vibe here. Daily grind is a good
    thing. You should learn something everyday be it a really small thing. There's so much out there to learn and do.
    Just pick the thing you wish to learn or find interesting and get grinding.
  </p>

  <p>If you every feel like quitting just remember why you started and how far you've come from that part. Ofc, there
    are times when you go through shit but it doesn't mean that you have to just stay in there and keep on overthinking
    about it. Skipping for a couple of days (for me) makes me lazy to continue. That's why I learn everyday even if it's
    a little portion of the thing I'm learning.</p>

    There are things that might be repetative in this, idk i blind-wrote this randomly 'cause I felt like writing
    something. So yeah that's it. Good thing it it helped.
